Install Libreoffice Calc for knowledgebase mapping of porting.

Observations:

# following appears to identify key business procedures initiated by UI.
grep callback bin/mozilla/*.pl
# callbacks are passed in UI. Identified by bin/mozilla/<filename>.pl? and
#  passed parameters using http/cgi.

# standardized variables:
# rowcount =  used to count itemized rows, for example parts in an invoice
#             and passed via UI

ct = 'vendor' or 'customer' (or 'contact')

queries are built from SL/*.pm and bin/mozilla/*.pl. Check header of *.pl for
reference to *.pm

SL/Form.pm contains form building routines and other utilities, such as number
formatting, locale translation etc.



Use qfo_sp_table_g2 to build table reports.

########Agenda:


transpose/port dynamically generated SL queries to OpenACS xql files to be called by tcl. Use the package table definitions  verify with psql logs for literal queries. Avoid building dynamic sql queries for security reasons.
transfer queries to .xql files as close to original as possible (ie use asterisk if there, then later, convert asterisks to explicit field names --to save time, to accelerate to alpha stage.

Pages (and queries) are built using ledger123/??.pl which calls bin/mozilla/??.pl which imports SL/??.pm and Form.pm  See notes-priorities.txt for order of processing/porting..


review business logic in SL procs. port to appropriate packges in the port.


requirement1: create object-like field definition procs like in hosting-farm, except each field is a name/value list with attributes: fieldname value(default:see datatype), title, datatype, context**, scalared_array_p(default:0)***. So the field-like definition procs will return list_of_lists.

**context is the grouping of fields (kind of like fieldset), except the html for these fields are output into variable called "context" so that can be readily input into a template, such as accounts-ledger/www/admin/test-lib-page-frags-with-equalize.adp but located in accounts-ledger/lib

*** scalared_array_p indicates that the variable is a scalared array, so consider cases name_1 ... name_N  For security, the value of N maybe passed as a hidden variable via db instead of form... something like qal__context_max
###Note, this is not used. Use: qfo::form_list_def_to_css_table_rows and qal_3g.




################ Done -----------------

q-control user permissions RBAC/IAM based [Done]
q-data-types for validation of more specific data types [Done ]
q-forms form handing routines for app building [Done]


build qal_3g based on qfo_2g.  qal_3g spits out a series of form values based on the value of context, instead of qfo_2g's one form_html.[Done]


make a map of cooresponding table and field names between ledger123 and accounts-* packages. NO, just ledger123 tables to accounts-* tables.. [Done] and

note all differences in the accounts-*-create.sql files (and any other porting notes).[Done]

requirement2: incorporate scalared arrays, where arrays or lists are adapted to html forms by adding a suffix number. x(1) becomes x_1, x(2) -> x_2 ... x_N. This way rows of data may be handled similarly. [Done: qfo::form_list_def_to_css_table_rows & qfo_3g]



make a map of SL subroutines (sub sub_name) to file, as some names are shared in different files..
Do subroutines that share same name have same code in each case? Or different?
[Done]


work on accounts-ledger focused items first.
 Any queries with shared AR go in AR.
 Any queries with shared AP go in AP
 Any queries with shared AP/AR go in accounts-ledger


admin.pl (to administer db and user permissions etc.)
setup.pl (to setup system)
In /ledger123 (different than ./bin/mozilla/.), following have EXACT SAME code --no execptions--, and pull in the name of the file as a means to differentiate:
   131 admin.pl
   131 login.pl
   234 am.pl
   234 ap.pl
   234 ar.pl
   234 bp.pl
