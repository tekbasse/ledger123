dir: ledger123

Agenda:
make a table cooresponding table and field names between ledger123 and accounts-* packages. NO, just ledger123 tables to accounts-* tables.. and note all differences in the accounts-*-create.sql files (and any other porting notes).


admin.pl (to administer db and user permissions etc.)
setup.pl (to setup system)
In /ledger123 (different than ./bin/mozilla/.), following have exact same code, and pull in the name of the file as a means to differentiate:
   131 admin.pl
   131 login.pl
   234 am.pl
   234 ap.pl
   234 ar.pl
   234 bp.pl
   234 ca.pl
   234 cp.pl
   234 ct.pl
   234 gl.pl
   234 hr.pl
   234 ic.pl
   234 im.pl
   234 ir.pl
   234 is.pl
   234 jc.pl
   234 menu.pl
   234 oe.pl
   234 pe.pl
   234 ps.pl
   234 rc.pl
   234 reports.pl
   234 rp.pl
   234 trf.pl
   234 vr.pl
   552 setup.pl

sql -- contains setup for database
SL -- contains business code and SQL queries
bin -- contains code that sets defaults that get passed to SL lib/modules
